## 🌍 The Short Version

I help numbers make sense and stories make an impact.

My roots are in **actuarial science** where I mastered the precision of numbers, yet curiosity soon drew me into the broader world of data science and analytics. Now I work at the intersection of **risk, behaviour, and intelligent systems,** turning a pile of possibilities into practical, actionable decisions.

If you arrived expecting just another developer profile, you may want to pour yourself a coffee and stay a little longer. I see data not simply as numbers in a spreadsheet, but as a living map of behaviours, risks, opportunities, and stories that have not yet been told.

Over the years, my journey has moved from calculating probabilities to building models that **explain, predict, and guide decisions** in the real world. Whether I am working on predictive algorithms, behavioural analytics, or data pipelines, my goal is always the same: create insights that are not only **accurate** but truly **meaningful** to the people who use them.

## 🧠 How I Approach Data

Data isn’t just numbers. It’s patterns, behaviours, risks, opportunities and signals waiting to be decoded.

First I meet the characters, which are the variables and values. Then I follow the clues, clean the evidence, connect the dots, and uncover the plot. The ending is never just a statistic. It is a clear recommendation, a story stakeholders can act on, and a solution that works beyond the lab.

My process blends industry intuition from hands-on work in insurance operations and customer analytics with academic depth from my current Master’s studies, all supported by a commitment to practical innovation.

## 🛠 My Technical Toolkit

I speak **Python** fluently and use it daily for analysis, automation, and building models. When statistical precision is key, I turn to **R**. **SQL** is my trusted partner for navigating complex relational databases, and **JavaScript** comes into play when I bridge data with interactive interfaces.

For machine learning, I rely on **Scikit-learn** for dependable classical models and **TensorFlow** with **Keras** for deep learning. **Pandas** and **NumPy** form the backbone of my data wrangling, while natural language processing toolkits help me transform raw text into meaningful insight.

When it comes to visual storytelling, I use **Tableau** for polished boardroom-ready dashboards and **Power BI** for connected, scalable reporting. **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** allow me to explore patterns visually, and **Streamlit** helps me share models in interactive and user-friendly applications.

On the data engineering side, I design **ETL pipelines**to take raw, messy data and transform it into clean, structured assets. I integrate data sources using **APIs** and maintain version control on **GitHub** to ensure reproducibility and smooth collaboration.

## 🔄 My Problem-Solving Flow


```
Understand → Prepare → Explore → Model → Evaluate → Communicate → Improve
```

I don’t believe in “magic models”,  I believe in **purpose-driven pipelines** that:

* Start with the *right* question
* Respect the data’s reality (cleaning counts!)
* Translate results into decisions people can act on
* Keep evolving as the problem changes

## 💡 My Philosophy

- **Purpose First** – Know *why* before *how* . Purpose always comes first.
- **Story Over Stats** - Insights only matter if they can be understood and acted upon.
- **Iterate Relentlessly** – Good models become great through feedback
- **Ethical AI** - Ethics and responsibility are just as important as accuracy in artificial intelligence. That means accuracy is nothing without responsibility
- **Collaboration Wins** - Collaboration turns good ideas into great ones.
